# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you set up the Voice Agent Platform on your local machine using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
- Accounts for:
  - **LiveKit** (Cloud or Self-hosted)
  - **Vobiz** (For Telephony)
  - **OpenAI** (or provider of choice)

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Piyush-sahoo/Voice-AI-Platform.git
cd Voice-AI-Platform
```

## 2. Configure Environment

The platform uses a unified environment file for simplicity in development.

```bash
# Copy the example env file
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env.local
```

Open `backend/.env.local` and populate your keys:

```ini
# LiveKit Configuration
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-project.livekit.cloud
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# AI Providers
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=...

# Database
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/vobiz

# Vobiz Telephony (SIP)
SIP_OUTBOUND_TRUNK_ID=...
```

## 3. Start Services

Run the entire stack with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This may take a few minutes the first time as it downloads images and builds the Python services.

## 4. Verify Installation

Once running, access the services:

- **Frontend Dashboard**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **API Documentation**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

### Run Automation Test
To verify everything is working correctly, run the included test script:

```bash
python scripts/full_api_automation.py
```

You should see a series of green checks ✅ validationg the Agents, Database, and SIP connection.
